# Security Automation: Extract Executable from PCAP

**Hands-on Activity 8.1**  

This repository contains **Hands-on Activity 8.1** from **CPE 213-CPE32S21 - Cloud Management and Security**. It demonstrates the use of **Ansible automation** to extract executable files from network traffic captured in **PCAP files**, simulating real-world **network forensics and security tasks**.  

---

**Project Objectives**
- Automate extraction of executables from PCAP files using Ansible.
- Verify connectivity between control and managed nodes.
- Streamline repetitive security analysis tasks.

---

**Simulation Environment**
- Ubuntu Server nodes on VirtualBox.
- One node as Ansible control, others as managed hosts.
- Automated tasks include installing required tools, extracting executables, and verifying results.

**Key Skills Demonstrated**
Ansible, Network Security, Linux System Administration, Security Automation, Network Forensics, SSH Key Management

---

**Reflections**
This activity strengthened my understanding of **security automation and network forensics**. Automating extraction of executables from network traffic improves efficiency, consistency, and reduces human error, providing hands-on experience in **practical security operations**.
